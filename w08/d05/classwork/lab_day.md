# Full Day Lab

1. Finish Todo App
	- Either starting from Thursday morning or from what you have currently.
	- Consider refactoring the 
	
2. Finish Last Nights Coffee Shop Homework

Before jumping immediately into coding, take stock of where you are. Make two lists, prompt specific and general.  What concepts are you still confused by? Be specific! What parts of your code do you look at and see monsters?

Don't avoid the monsters. Like Amerigo Vespucci, Jean Luc Picard and Dora the Explorer say:

"Boldly go where no man has gone before" - Jean Luc

"Come on, v√°monos!" - Dora

And whatever Vespucci would say to his friends to make them journey into the unknown...

Regardless of which which prompt you choose to tackle, aim for completion.

## But what if I'm done?!?

If you finish the prompt you chose you could:

	- Start/Finish the other prompt (if you feel like you need the extra reps)
	- Implement React Router to better guide your components (move to the next feature)
	    https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial
	    https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/tree/master/docs
	
Consider the following prompts: 

Todo App:

	Your client is thrilled with the product. The timer feature for each task is exactly what they envisioned. But they realized that they would like a way to save lists of tasks so they could better organize. 
	
	Before working on the feature they'd like to see a plan of action in terms of what parts of the app will need to be restructured/rebuilt to account for this new feature and what new components you'll be adding. 
	
Coffee Shop:

	You've crushed it. The Bari-C-Suite is totally impressed with the app. In fact, the app has been so succesful that you've automated a couple people out of jobs. This has, luckily for you and for those now obsolete chalk board menu scrawlers, allowed the coffee shop to open a couple more cafe's in the area. The app now needs to account for multiple stores menus. The Cabal of Baristas requests a way to keep track of this so they can keep them dollars rolling, also you're pretty sure the oddly vicious chalk art outside your building is not just coincidence.
	
	The Cabal also requests an outline of how you plan to go about modifying their currently profitable app before you start mucking it up like first wave coffee clerk trying to make latte art.
