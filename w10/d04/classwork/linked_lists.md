# Linked List

Today we will build our own new data structure. The
[Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) is a very
common computer science construct, as fundamental as arrays. We will
use an arrays and linked lists to build a [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))


Write a class `Stack` which has the following signature (use an array
for the implementation)

- `initialize` initializes a new stack 
- `push` add an element to the end of the linked list
- `pop` remove the last element of the linked list
- `isEmpty?` predicate to determine is stack is empty
- `size` returns the number of elements in the stack

Now write a stack which uses a linked list 

Write a class `Node` which should have only a current
*value* and a reference to the *next* node as instance variables. They
should be supplied on initialization. Use the `nodes` to implement
your stack
