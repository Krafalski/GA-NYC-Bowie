# Episode 7: A New Terminal

A long time ago in a unix environment far, far away, young Jedi padawans who
knew only of desktop software were seduced by the dark side of the Force to
enterâ€¦ The Terminal.

Follow the instructions below using all the console commands introduced in
Fundamentals, class, or that you find on your own.

## Learning objective
Today we want you to be comfortable traversing your way through a file system using the terminal and keeping markdown notes.

## Setup
Work in any directory of your choosing. We will introduce the class repo and official homework submission process tomorrow.


## Completion
Finish all of the parts! In the future we may set reach goals and add bonuses onto the homework, however we decided to go with an easier assignment to help get you acclimated to the course. The main purpose of this assignment is to get you feeling comfortable typing and working inside the terminal.

## Set the Scene

1. Open the **Terminal app**
2. Create a **homework** directory in a sensible location and copy this markdown file in that directory.
3. Rename the file to **solution.md** and open it in your editor. As you work through the assignment you will be filling out this file with the commands you are running.
4. Create a new directory called "**galaxy_far_far_away**" and enter it.
    ```sh
    paste the commands you used to do this step here
    ```

    ```

6. In "**galaxy_far_far_away**", make a directory named "**tatooine**" and create the following files in it: "**luke.txt**", "**ben_kenobi.txt**"

Already feeling comfortable with these commands and want an extra challenge? Try
doing the following:

* Try applying one command to multiple files at once.
* Try applying one command to **all** files in a single directory (where necessery)
* Try applying one command to **all files that match a pattern**.
* Find and use command line shortcuts.
* Try using a mix of absolute and relative paths.
