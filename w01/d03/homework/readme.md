## JavaScript Drills!

### Setup

Today you are going to write JavaScript statements to solve the following problems. This assignment is to get you to started thinking like a developer. The most important part of the assignment is to practice your git workflow, work on a separate branch, make commits after every completed part, embrace git! After you are done push your branch to github and submit a pull request.

You will be working in the `w01/d03/homework/` directory where you will find this exercise prompt and a starter js file.

Your solutions will go in their respective places in the `starter.js` file

Practice your javascript in the node console. When you get something working paste it in your `starter.js` file under the relevant comment.

After you finish each part, it's a good habit to save your work. Do this by committing your changes to `git`.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "finished part deuce"
```

Open the `starter.js` file.

#### 1. Pythagorean Theorem

Write a JavaScript statement that can solve the pythagorean theorem.
Don't know it? Google might! :smile:

#### 2. Basic Conversion - Pounds to kg

How would you convert weights in pounds to kilograms?

#### 3. Old Modems

How long would it take to download a 25GB ripped copy of Blade Runner over a $200 56k/s modem from 1995? That's kbps, **kilobit**, not kilobyte. You're going to have to dig for conversion here. Save the calculated answer to a variable and then output the answer in an alert.

Bonus:
- **_note: make sure your answer is converted in the form of hours:minutes:seconds. This can be done with the modulus operator(%)_**

#### 4. Killer Caffeine

It's estimated that 6 grams per hundred pounds of body weight can cause death! Given an 8oz cup of coffee has 95mg of caffeine, calculate how many cups it takes to kill YOU.

#### 5. Push homework to github

Follow the instructions in the homework submission how-to located in our wiki. Have a pull request submitted! 

#### Don't forget to sleep!!!!
