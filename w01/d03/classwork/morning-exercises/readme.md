# Setting up Git!

## Introduction

This morning we are going to explore and setup your class repo!

## Part 1

Take around 10 minutes to play around with git. Go to https://try.github.io and try it out. This will introduce you to some of the great features of version control. Try to complete the first 12 challenges. If you have extra time feel free to continue.

## Part 2

Out repo has a wiki! This is another great feature that github offers. We will be using this wiki to compile useful resources, which you can use as references as you go to the course. Go ahead and take some time to explore the wiki. Find a page we created for you with the title **Morning Exercise Page** and add an appropriate entry to it. 

## Part 3

Now we will setup your repos. We will do this together, but there is a How To written in the wiki which you should read after today's lesson, which goes over the entire process.
