# Dice Roller

Build an app which allows the user to roll dice. 

## Express

Use express as a very basic server with one route which serves an
index page and public stylesheets and javascript files. 

Your index page should have an input field of type number and a Roll
button.

## Front End

Implement the following functionaloty using front end javascript and
any styling of you choosing.

When the Roll button is pressed the user should be presented with as
many six sided dice as they put into the input field. Their face
values should be randomly generated. Successive presses of the roll
button should generate new dice.
