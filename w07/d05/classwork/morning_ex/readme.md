# Calendar

Your task is to build a simple calendar app. Use express to serve you
index page and static files. Use client side Javascript to achieve the functionality. Do not worry about persisting any data to the backend. 

Suggestion: a more user friendly alternative to the Javascript's date object is [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/).

A user should he able to create an event with a name, date, and time.

A user should be able to see a chronologically ordered list of their events. 

A user should be able to see the day of the week on which their event is scheduled

Bonus: Allow the user to change their timezone.

Bonus: Format your events listing in a monthly grid.
