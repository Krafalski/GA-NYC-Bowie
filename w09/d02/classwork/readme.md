# Underscore.JS

This morning you will explore a really helpful Javascript library
called [Underscore.JS](http://underscorejs.org/). Underscore provides
very handy helper functions for iterating and manipulating arrays and
objects. It also gives more advanced and quite useful feature for
function binding, chaining, front - end templates etc. 

Split up into your assigned project groups. Each group will focus on
researching the following underscore methods:

1. `each`
2. `map`, `pluck`
3. `find`, `findWhere`: 
4. `filter`, `reject`
5. `every`, `some`, `contains`
6. `uniq`
7. `shuffle`
8. `range`

Produce a write up of your findings. Include at minimum the following sections:

1. What does the function do? Explain it in your own way and don't
   just copy the docs.
2. Provide an instructive example of usage.
3. Provide an extensively  commented version of the source code for
   the function. 
4. How would you accomplish the same thing in Javascript yourselves?
   What makes the underscore implementation better (or worse)?
5. Give an example of where you would use the function in any of your
   own projects, assignments
