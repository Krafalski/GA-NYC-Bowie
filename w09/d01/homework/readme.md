# Stand alone practice

Finish our toy example from class. Have a working app with
authentication and a react-router nav bar. Make sure you can:

1. Sign up
2. Log in
3. Log out
4. Navigate to different routes. Have them show content only if you
   are authenticated
   
# Integration

Implement authentication and authorization for the movie-haus
application from the weekend. 

1. Allow any user on the website to view the currently playing
movies. 
2. Allow only logged in users to search for new movies and add them to
   the list of currently showing movies
3. Allow only logged in users to edit the show times. 
4. Make sure you implement authentication for the API as well. It is
   not enough to not show an edit button to the user. You should not
   be able to post (or put, or delete) even from postman unless you
   include a token. 
   
5. Use `react-router` to control the different views in your
   application.
