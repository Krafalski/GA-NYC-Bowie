# Working with docs and examples:
### We're real developers now


Your coffee shop client, moviehaus, and the client who asked you to build the
todo app are all very pleased with your work. But the apps just aren't dynamic
enough. They're all pretty clear on the fact they want users now. These apps won't
just be information based and enterprise facing like the coffee shop
and moviehaus, nor merely a proof of concept like ToDo.

Faced with this task of implementing Authorization and Authentication you begin your
research.

Any new feature requires a list of problems to be solved, a fair amount of
research and your due diligence that the technologies will work reasonably
far into the future.

You've spent all morning setting up tokens to be used with your single page
applications in a dummy app. And you've proven that the routes work as expected
when you hit them with curl or postman.


## How do we build the front end

We've done part of this research for you. There are a ton of other tools to help
manage state and making your pages dynamic.

Redux/Flux to help manage state, multiple different versions react router and auth.

We settled on this auth-flow example straight form the react-router documentation.

#### _BUT_

There's a ton of little pieces in here you don't know yet or haven't seen yet.

And this isn't your code, and so you don't necessarily understand how it flows.

### Step 1

Take 30 minutes to go through this code and comment every piece that seems new
or things you don't understand.

These could be React syntax, React lifecycle methods, callback flow(hell), js syntax

### Step 2

We'll come together and list all of what we commented on the board with line numbers

And we can divide and conquer.
