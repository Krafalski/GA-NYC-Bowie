# Largest Palindrome (Project Euler Problem 4)

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Special Pythagorean Triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

> a^2 + b^2 = c^2
For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product abc.
