### Weather Search

This morning you will build a simple weather search app. Use the [Open
Weather API](http://openweathermap.org/api).

### Starter Code

You are provided with starter code in your classwork directory. Your
index page is built and has two forms which should allow you to search
for weather by city name or by zip code. Explore how the forms request
data from your server.

### Routes

Build the required two extra routes on your server to handle the
request from the forms on the index page.

### Views

Make the views for those routes and have them render in the browser
placeholder information. Your views should at minimum show at minimum
be able to show:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Description

### API

Explore the Open Weather API and use the request module to fetch
relevant information in each of your two routes. Have your views
render accurate information.

### Bonus
Style your new app, so it looks impressive to potential employers!
