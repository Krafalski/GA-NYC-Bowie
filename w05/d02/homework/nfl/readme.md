# The NFL

### Step 1

You are provided with a schema file `schema.sql` and two seed files
`players.sql`, `teams.sql`. Create a new database called `nfl` and use
the schema and seed file to populate your database.

_note_: The players and teams tables are **related**.


### Step 2
Create a new file called `nfl.md`. In this file write your answers to step 3.

### Step 3 - Queries

Some queries may require more than one command (i.e. you may need to get information about a team before you can complete a query for players). Test each command in PSQL to make sure it is correct:

- List the names of all NFL teams
- List the stadium name and head coach of all NFC teams
- List the head coaches of the AFC South
- The total number of players in the NFL
- The team names and head coaches of the NFC North and AFC East
- The 50 players with the highest salaries
- The average salary of all NFL players
- The names and positions of players with a salary above 10_000_000
- The player with the highest salary in the NFL
- The name and position of the first 100 players with the lowest salaries
- The average salary for a DE in the nfl
- The names of all the players on the Buffalo Bills
- The total salary of all players on the New York Giants
- The player with the lowest salary on the Green Bay Packers

_hint_: In order to do some parts you will need to research commands we did
not cover in class.

_challange_: Complete each part with a single SQL expression. That is
possible, but will involve learning how to use compound SQL
expressions.
