# MTA in Browser

You are tasked with making a website for customers of the MTA. You need to implement the following user stories:

1. A user can see a list of all lines in the MTA
2. A user can click on a line and see all stops for that line
3. A user can select two stops out of all available stops and they should receive a summary of their trip between the two stops.
- First focus on displaying the number of stops they need to travel
- Then try displaying all stop they will visit during their trip

## Suggestions

1. First spend some time designing a rough mockup of the layout. You have to display certain data and allow for user interactions. You as a developer need to decide how to deliver that information to the user.
2. After you have a rough layout think about your html structure. You do not need to worry about styling at first, but you must have an idea of the building blocks that will make up your page. What do you need to wrap in a `div` tag so that you can style it later?
3. Decide whether you will write the html statically (in the index.html file) or you are actually going to build up the DOM with javascript. Both ways are possible and carry their own sets of challenges. Make sure you have a reason for choosing one over the other.
4. After you have static content on the webpage, start implementing the event listeners to respond to user actions. Try to keep everything modular. Wrap everything in functions and reuse those functions.
5. Practice your css. Make it pretty!
