added and commented on a JavaScript/JSON snippet
In the United Kingdom the ton is defined as 2,240 pounds (1,016 kg) (avoirdupois pounds).[2] From 1965 the UK embarked upon a programme of metrication and gradually introduced metric units, including the tonne (metric ton), defined as 1000 kg (2,204.6 lbs). The UK Weights and Measures Act 1985 explicitly excluded from use for trade many units and terms, including the ton and the term "metric ton" for "tonne".[3]
​
In the United States and formerly Canada[4] a ton is defined to be 2,000 pounds (907 kg).

@jasonseminara: Can you try redirecting from a PUT route to a GET route? everyone here is getting stuck in an infinite redirect loop

jason Seminara [20:27]
why not?
```   //redirect to the new burger
    res.redirect('./' + bID)```

Harry Ganz [20:32]
Because it will always use the same request as before

[20:32]
*same  method

[20:32]
It is
```res.redirect(303, '/path')```
(edited)

[20:33]
303 means use GET
1

[20:33]
it took me over an hour to figure that out

jason Seminara [20:58]
why would you nd up in a loop? Why are you redirecting back to the source? The correct path should be `burgers/1/edit —[PUT]—> burgers/1 —[redirect]—>burgers/`

[20:58]
form -> accept form —> show list view

[21:00]
also, you’re not doing a true redirection, you don’t need a status code.

Harry Ganz [21:03]
ok, try it. I couldn't get it to work any other way

it’s a proof of concept / prototype at best.  It’s got lots of security holes and missing features.

[22:16]
BUT

[22:17]
Now that you know how to get an up-and-running website in a few hours, you can whip up a clickable prototype for that indecisive client and  impress your boss. Your Time+happy client+getting called out for being a team-player in front of the CTO = bonus!

[22:19]
also, as a freelancer, you should be pricing things hourly. How much time would it take you to make something? This is why your rate goes up as you gain more experience.

[22:20]
NEVER price a project unless you KNOW for certain how many hours it will take you and you’ve already decided what your hourly rate would look like

Viorel Belfiore [22:20]
For a beginner web developer what’s the starting hourly rate you would recommend asking for? (usually)

jason Seminara [22:21]

Hey, when we were using express-session and connect-pg-simple yesterday, we created a users table in our sessiontest database - did we manually create the session table that stored the cookies?

So, the burger homework, not talking about the actual code, bu I'm not sure exactly how the homepage and 'all burgers' are supposed to be different. Seems like it might just be showing the same thing. So, why do we have both? Does that make sense?

[11:13]
Like, all of the burgers show up on the homepage anyway

Patrick McWilliams [11:18]
might be “best practice” practice? on your typical homepage you’re not going to want a giant list of things, instead you’d want a link/button to “all the things”. so you’d need a homepage and a full-listing page

Caleb Rechten [11:19]
That's what I would normally do, yeah, but the example html provided has the burgers showing on the homepage.

[11:19]
So it's confusing me.

Colin Hart [11:20]
dont let it confuse you, You do you  :stuck_out_tongue:

Sara Horowitz [11:20]
@feudi connect-pg-simple will create the session table for you when you install it

Colin Hart [11:20]

Caleb Rechten [11:20]
Okay, cool. I just wasn't sure if there was 'actually' a reason for it.

Jonathan Feudi [11:21]
@sarahorowitz I created it manually, I’m not sure it will find the proper database/table unless you are already connected to it through postgres

You can seed that to your DB if your session table doesn’t auto-create

Hey guys, I was struggling a bit with understanding SQL ‘JOIN’ statements so I wrote a page on the wiki about them. Its from the ground-up and pretty lengthy, but I think it does a good job explaining them.

I also was looking for a way to use one statement to return all of the meat, bread, different toppings, and different cheeses for the burg-o-rama in one clear table, so even if you understand the basic concept of joins its worth it to search the page for ‘burg-o-rama’ as it uses a new query method we havent learned!

Hopefully this helps some of you guys - writing it helped me! https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-nyc-bowie_students/wiki/postgreSQL-Join-Guide

ejs seems to hate "undefined". So it looks like I can't leave ejs tags with code that only runs when objects or variables are defined. Anyone work around this?

Caleb Rechten [07:47]
I mean, I suppose I could assign it something in the route.js file regardless of it needing that data and then just check that value in the ejs file and take action depending on it's value.

Caleb Rechten [08:01]
Yeah, that totally works. Don't know if it's the best way, but it works.

If anyone is still super confused about CRUD, I created a realllllllly simple app for you (no sessions or any of that ish).
I have CREATE and READ all set up for you, and if you can figure that out you can figure out the remaining 2.
Everything is commented out almost obsessively, with elaborate explanations, in very non-technical terms.

Caleb Rechten [08:02]
I'm working on setting up the login system with sessions, did we have to create a sessions table for it to work, or is that something that should be automatically generated? It's yelling at me for not being able to find a sessions table, but I don't see anything on creating a sessions table.

Maxwell Rayman [08:20]
```psql db_name_here < node_modules/connect-pg-simple/table.sql ```

[08:22]
 ```app.use(session({
  store: new pgSession({
    pg : pg,
    conString : connectionString,
    tableName : 'session'
  }),
  secret : 'soooosecreetttt',
  resave : false,
  cookie : { maxAge : 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 } // 30 days
}))```

[08:23]
have you done those two yet? first line is in your terminall second part is in server.js with pg required and a connectionstring

Caleb Rechten [08:28]
I did the second part, but not the command line bit. I knew there was something like that, but couldn't remember what it was. That should do it, checking now. Thanks Max!

Yep, that's all it was.

sometimes my server dies randomly and I have to restart nodemon for seemingly no reason - this happen to anyone else? (edited)

Maxwell Rayman [21:41]
so apparently sometimes if your postgres functions dont have
```done()```
in them it will sometimes freeze up the server on a request

Karolin Rafalski [21:42]
is that what was causing nodemon to crash?

Maxwell Rayman [21:48]
nodemon wasnt crashing my server just was freezing and nothing was happening in nodemon unless i restarted it

[21:48]
adding done() fixed it

Note, do not name an object key being passed into an ejs file 'delete'. It doesn't like it and I'm guessing probably thinks it means something other than just being a key.

anyone using Atom find a way to make it not get angry with line breaks between quotes? I really want to format my sql statements, but it won't let me. I searched around briefly packages to install, but I don't see anything. But there's got to be one, right? It's too annoying.

Peter Nguyen [08:38]
@umbrellagun: you mean breaking up your super long sql statement ?

[08:39]
I was stuck on that for the longest time yesterday but if you wrap each segment with quotes and concatenate them, it should work. Well for me at least

Harry Ganz [08:51]
@umbrellagun: Use backticks instead of quote marks (per ES6) and add this to your package.json:
```"jshintConfig": {
    "node": true,
    "esversion": 6
  },
```

# Heroku Setup Steps
​
1. from command line, nav to git directory
1. `heroku login`
1. `heroku create`
 - automatically adds a heroku destination
1. `git remote -v`
 - to check that heroku destination was added
1. `echo "web: node server.js" > Procfile`
 - do this to make sure that Heroku knows this is a node.js app
1. `git push heroku master`
 - pushes the contents of the git directory on heroku and does some magic
1. `heroku open` launches the site
 - ** package.json scripts section requires a `start: node server.js` in it**
1. from Heroku dashboard, add postgres DB for the newly created site
  `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
      var config = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
    } else {
      // local config
    }`
1. `heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production`
 - to set an environment variable. in db js file(s), add conditional to check the node env variables
1. from psql, copy over db into Heroku `heroku pg:push our-spots DATABASE_URL`

Remember to push your database before testing your heroku site, otherwise you'll probably get errors because it's dependent on sessions.
