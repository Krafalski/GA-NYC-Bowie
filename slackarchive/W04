Congrats on project 1 completion. In case you ever need a reminder of alllllllll the things you learned in 3 weeks, here it is. Yes, I know you can't read them, but they should be ingrained in your brain anyway

@ group if you get a favicon error add the following:
```
**Chrome and the favicon**
 - Chrome makes two requests to the server... the second request is for the favicon. What a pain in the ass.

```javascript
 if (request.url === '/favicon.ico') {
    request.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'image/x-icon'} );
    rrequest.end();
    console.log('favicon requested');

and threw it at the front of the “if… else…” train, but this part might not be necessary?

Karolin Rafalski [19:34]
I think we were told to put it aside for now, as it doesn’t affect the functionality of our code and it seemed really finicky when we tried to get it to work in class. Anyone else have any answers?

are switch statements like a fancy key-value pair thing or something else? i ask because colons.

Peter Nguyen [14:44]
They're a fancy version of if/else

Patrick McWilliams [14:45]
right, but the formatting reminds me of key:value

[14:45]
case x: expression

[14:45]
which kind of acts like an object in that if you call the case/key you get the expression/value

Peter Nguyen [14:47]
True but from what I understand switch case statements are just a fancier version of if/else statements

undecided- maybe get there after 2. Definitely going in tomorrow

Adam Kriger [10:37]
@karolin: I mean the code that Jason uploaded for us to use as a model

Karolin Rafalski [10:38]
what’s the name of the file?

Adam Kriger [10:40]
@karolin: it’s called server.js in the restaurants directory within the classwork directory

Karolin Rafalski [10:42]
ah, I was looking at it but did not try to run it…let me try running it

Adam Kriger [10:42]
ok

Karolin Rafalski [10:43]
there are no node modules in the directory. Remember how we have git ignore and don’t pull the node module files down?

[10:43]
so to try to run those we’d have to do the npm installs of all the required modules in that directory

Adam Kriger [10:44]
Right, Elton also  suggested we have to install a bunch of things via npm installer to make it work

[10:46]
npm init, npm install express, npm install request, imp install morgan, npm install ejs, npm install express (edited)

Karolin Rafalski [10:47]

is it possible to link a .html.ejs page to a .css page?  anyone know how to get those things working together?

@ariingber: add the following code to your JS file and then link your CSS as you normally would in your HTML.eja file. app.use( express.static('views') );
