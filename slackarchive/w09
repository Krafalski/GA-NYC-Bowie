@group For ANYONE in this channel who wants something to fill the minutes in between working project 3, i started a March Madness pool on CBS for the class. So far its just me and Bryce but anyone is welcome to compete! Were just doing a $5 buy-in to keep it fun but interesting.

This means if you want to play just sign up on the website, click on your name to create your bracket, and give me $5 by 10:00 AM on Thursday.
