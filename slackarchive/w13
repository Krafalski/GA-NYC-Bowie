Lunch at Storehouse on 26th and 6.

[12:22]
23rd and 6

Colin Hart [13:11]
@group

So, Heiwad Osman, the Product Manager Immersive Instructor here at GA is running a small workshop with his PMI class. If you want to sign up, the lesson is about  estimating complexity of user stories for apps style app

You'll have a set of cards with different story point values on them.

You’ll give an estimate and when that estimate diverges from the other developers, there will be a discussion about what factors into the complexity.

TL,DR

PMI students will present the user stories, developers estimate, ask questions, and talk about technical complexity.

So you’ll be going in as “experts” helping the project management students practice managing user stories and so forth and also get experience thinking about complex problems and estimating the time (A super valuable professional skill as well as good practice for similar questions you’ll get on interviews.)

It’s also at 11am so you have time to sleep in on Wednesday

If you’re interested, I know several Android students from the recent class have signed up, fill out the form below:

https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/forms/d/1QGF3hhdSKnimx6J9GCOqyNliRj0gG4pC3_Yco72sb08/viewform?c=0&w=1
Google Docs
Cookies & Planning Poker on 4/13
Come learn about Planning Poker - an Agile technique for estimation. It's a framework for having meaningful team conversations wrapped in a game. You'll be matched with fellow developers and some Product Management students to simulate an Agile planning session for an app or website. When: Wednesday 4/13 Time: 11AM - 12PM Where: Classroom 3E This is an interest check. If there are enough survey responses, we'll confirm with an email & calendar invite. (104KB)

My first coding challenge. For a job at Verbal+Visual.

Adam Kriger [13:11]
```TASK 1

Images: Provided in Zip File
Photoshop File: Provided in Zip File
Fonts: Karla Regular, Karla Bold (available for free via Google Fonts)

Task: Develop an HTML page based off the design. Make sure it is responsive using Bootstrap, and pixel perfect to the design.

To be done:

– Main image with CSS gradient overlay, full screen stretch
– Use Bootstrap
– No menu required
– Responsive to tablet
– Arrow scrolls you down the page so that the white nav bar is at top of the screen

Up to you:
– Responsive to mobile
– Loader for main image
– Buttons have rollover effects
– Lines over Second Section area move slightly as you scroll down the page (parallax)
– Second image loads in from white as you scroll down the page
– Optimize the page load speed by optimizing the images for load time without losing picture quality, and refactor your code to optimize load time
– Animate the arrow on rollover
– Anything else you can come up with that will make the page better

Deliverables:
– HTML, CSS, JS.

How to Submit:
– Email careers@verbalplusvisual.com with a zip file of your final files

Anyone flipping out over filling taxes, the deadline is the 18th this year, which makes HRblock doing maintenance today only irritating and not painful.

Harry Ganz [18:01]
I feel your pain. I finished mine just before we left for K-town. Also, sing up for my slack channel before this one dies

[18:02]
Also also, add your contact info to the google doc before the contact channel dies

Caleb Rechten [18:07]
@harryg:  Did you make an entirely new slack for it? Or is it a channel in the GA alumni?

Harry Ganz [18:09]
No, actually a new team. TBH I guess it would have made more sense as a channel in GA Alumni

[18:09]
Do you think I should get rid of the team and just make a channel?

Caleb Rechten [18:10]
It looks like that's what other groups did. It would also keep it centralized so I don't have to have two tabs open. Any counter thoughts?

Harry Ganz [19:24]
I can make sub-channels devoted to jobs and meetups, as opposed to one feed for everything

Karolin Rafalski [19:47]
One channel in GA please- I am on two other slack teams and it is a pain to go back and forth.

[19:49]
And Patrick, sorry,I finished my taxes a while ago but I feel for ya!

Harry Ganz [19:58]
Ok. I'll make a channel and clear the team

Harry Ganz [20:09]
@group many of us haven't joined the GAImmersiveAlumni team, so I don't kno what to make of that

Colin Hart [20:12]
Ga will also be providing you all with an alumni slack channel

[20:14]
You will all be removed from ga students on Monday I believe and invited the ga-alumni team

Smashing Magazine
The Beauty Of React Native: Building Your First iOS App With JavaScript (Part 1) – Smashing Magazine
The idea of building mobile apps with JavaScript is not new. We’ve seen frameworks like Ionic and PhoneGap take on the challenge, and to some extent succeed in gaining a fair amount of developer and community support. These frameworks and the whole idea of building mobile apps with JavaScript never appealed to me, though. I always thought, why not just learn Swift/Objective-C or Java and build real apps? That definitely requires a significant amount of learning, but isn’t that what we developers Show more...
