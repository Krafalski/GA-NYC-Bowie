Has anyone used Javascript with Rails yet?

Peter Petrov [10:33]
@umbrellagun: without any context if you are having troubles with javascript in rails disabling `turbo-links` might be a quick fix

Jonathan Feudi [11:23]

jason Seminara [11:46]
@group if you feel like showing off your RESTAURANT work to the rest of the GA community, I’ve copied the project prompt to its own repo https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/RESTaurant

GitHub
ga-wdi-exercises/RESTaurant
RESTaurant - A RESTful Restaurant API

Caleb Rechten [11:47]
That's okay

jason Seminara [11:47]
If you’d like to contrib, fork it, and add then new url as an upstream to your own repo

Colin Hart [12:03]

Caleb Rechten [12:04]
Thank you!

Colin Hart [12:04]
the other thing

[12:04]
actually

[12:05]
turning off turbo links

[12:05]
is no good

[12:05]
cause itll break your form fors etc

[12:05]
youll need to learn to write some sweet coffee script

[12:05]
http://coffeescript.org/

[12:05]
so it was breaking because there is no var in coffee script

Caleb Rechten [12:06]
Oh, so Rails has to deal with CoffeeScript?

Colin Hart [12:06]
yep

Caleb Rechten [12:06]
oh

[12:07]
Odd, I'll look into it. I wanted to explore server side stuff because of the idea of doing React + Rails.

[12:07]
client*

Colin Hart [12:12]
yeah, in doing react + rails

[12:12]
we will literally have two separate servers

[12:12]
a back end server

[12:12]
and a front end server

[12:13]
so your react will not live inside the rails app

[12:13]
BaaS backend as a service (edited)

Caleb Rechten [12:14]
Ohright, that was said, wasn't it.

Colin Hart [12:14]
yup lol

[12:15]
for react inside of the rails project you need to use the react-rails gem

Caleb Rechten [12:16]
So it looks like I might be able to run regular Javascript, but Rails just doesn't like anything to do with $(document).ready

[12:16]
Or Vanilla equivalent

Colin Hart [12:17]
​_coffescript_​

Caleb Rechten [12:17]
Because the document only loads once

Caleb Rechten [13:33]
Anyone send params to the next page without generating a new database item?

Jonathan Feudi [22:11]
Anyone have to hit the route in a different controller from a form?

[22:12]
I have a route for ‘tables’ in the restaurant, and I have a route for ‘tickets’ which are the joins between ‘items’ and ‘tables'

[22:12]
Trying to hit edit a ticket using a form on my tables route

[22:12]
Not having too much success

Colin Hart [22:17]
Are you passing  a specific path for the form_for to use?

[22:18]
or assuming rail magic? (edited)

[22:18]
@feudi:

Jonathan Feudi [22:18]
Hang on

[22:18]
 ```<%= form_for @ticket[i], url: {:controller => "tickets", action: "update"} do |f| %>```

[22:18]
Here is the beginning of my form

[22:18]
I have a feeling the @ticket[i] is tripping things up

[22:19]
Now, I’m not getting an error, but not updating the DB

Colin Hart [22:19]
see if you can give the url a string with the actual path

[22:19]
and specificy a third arg like method or action with :put

Jonathan Feudi [22:19]
I think I’m also not succeeding in handing in the proper id in the params

Colin Hart [22:19]
…. or maybe ‘put'

Jonathan Feudi [22:19]
Okay

Colin Hart [22:20]
sorry that’s not more specific

[22:20]
haha

Jonathan Feudi [22:20]
Yeah, it’s super weirdsies

Colin Hart [22:20]
just off the top of my head

[22:20]
not really, it’s that the dsl for form helpers is bogus (edited)

[22:20]
or not too weird

[22:20]
weird because of poor design

Jonathan Feudi [22:20]
Yeah, trying to change a column in your manual join table from outside the proper route doesn’t seem like it’s supposed to be easy

Colin Hart [22:21]
or maybe poor documentation

[22:21]
well the route just renders the view

Jonathan Feudi [22:21]
I mean

Colin Hart [22:21]
you should obviously have buttons and forms that hit any other route

Jonathan Feudi [22:21]
Outside the proper controller

[22:22]
Err… same controller. Proper isn’t the right word

Colin Hart [22:22]
hmmm wait, are you trying to

1. have a form hit a route that isn’t the controller that rendered it?
or
2: try to access controller a stuff in controller b after the form submits

Jonathan Feudi [22:22]
1

[22:23]
The form is being rendered on the ‘tables’ controller

Colin Hart [22:23]
okay, that’s totally fine

Jonathan Feudi [22:23]
I’m trying to use it to hit something on the ‘tickets’ controller

Colin Hart [22:23]
you just need to figure out the right arguments to pass to form_for

[22:23]
for that to work

Jonathan Feudi [22:24]
I’m not getting an error, but I’m not really sure if I’m passing the right :id and… ugh… all kinds of crap

Colin Hart [22:24]
binding.pry son

Jonathan Feudi [22:25]
Yeah, a lot of the numbers are the same… this is where Jason tells me to take a walk

Colin Hart [22:25]
or just write down specifically what you want to happen and what methods should be hit in what order

[22:25]
and what the data should be

[22:26]
and then throw binding.pry everywhere relavant

[22:26]
and seeing where it deviates

Jonathan Feudi [22:26]
Okay

[22:26]
Gonna give it a few more tries before I call it a night

[22:27]
OMG

[22:27]
...

[22:27]
There’s an authentication in my way

[22:28]
That’s re-routing me as soon as I touch the tickets controller

[22:28]
Cause I’m not logged in as a chef

[22:28]

[22:29]
Okay, getting somewhere now

My first experience with open data was in the year 2010. I wanted to create a better app for Bicing, the local bike sharing system in Barcelona.

@group react-native people.

Bad news:

The talk in the other class is off. It’s not actually about ReactNative, just react as that’s what they’re learning now.

Good news: I’m hoping the speaker can come to our classroom for 30m  at 12 and talk about React Native.

no promises, it would be out of the goodness of the speakers heart.

Vitaly should be on a stick, as a floating head

Caleb Rechten [14:21]
Maybe I'll just start naming as many variables as I can "Vitaly".

Karolin Rafalski [14:22]
do you think that’ll get him to forgive us for using firebase on our last project?

Jonathan Feudi [15:21]
@karolin: Vitaly is like a database - he does not forget.

[15:21]
Only time will tell if he has the capacity for forgiveness.

My sisters stike again

Jonathan Feudi [12:01]
Yo, have any of you guys made the mistake of initializing your Rails application and forgetting to set the DB to PSQL? Wondering if it’s worth going through the config stuff of changing it, or if I should just delete and re-initialize. I don’t have a ton done on the back end, so re-initializing isn’t the end of the world

[12:02]
@group

Colin Hart [12:05]
You couldvmake a new app and just copy the db yml file

[12:05]
From the new app to the okd

[12:05]
Old

[12:05]
That really should be all you need to do

Jonathan Feudi [12:06]
I just yanked all the files I had made changes to into another folder, and I’m reinitializing now, then putting my modified files back into the new application

[12:06]
But, thanks, I’ll remember that for future fuck-ups

Jonathan Feudi [12:25]
I think Rails is mad at me for putting the trying to use the Gemfile from another application...

[12:25]
Can’t start my server :sob:

@group FYI GA is closed today

[10:11]
@group Adam & I will be at Le Pan

Colin Hart [10:11]
… It shouldn’t be, try the 2nd floor

[10:12]
They were replacing tables this weekend on the third and fourth floor

Ari Ingber [10:12]
@group im on the third floor now, i think its open

Colin Hart [10:13]
Just keep in mind you might get forced to move around a little due to table replacements.

Jonathan Feudi [10:14]
The 2nd and 4th floors will be CLOSED Saturday 4/2 and Sunday 4/3 during the transition

[10:14]
From the email

Colin Hart [10:15]
word @group 3rd floor should be open, Thanks Feudi

Jonathan Feudi [10:15]
No prob

[10:15]
DOES ANYONE READ THEIR EMAIL?!

Jimmy Lin [10:15]
@ariingber: come down to open the door for us :)

Obviously some crazy science shit going on in the back. For the good of everyone.

Okay, seriously @group, if you have a spare moment check out this video on using graphql with node/express/postgres, pretty cool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNPVqK_woRQ (edited)

ALSO, @group, if you’re learning new things, React Native, Sockets, Redux, weird api’s, Rails etc.

Write up posts in the Wiki! They don’t have to be super long or really intense, but will help you internalize what you’ve learned and will be a resource for yourself and others during the next week and in the future, and are drafts for the blog you should also start after class ends. Slash, some of you are using technologies I’m not familiar with, and I want to ​_learn!!!_​ (edited)

@group what do you think of this article?  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learning-code-yields-diminishing-returns-douglas-rushkoff (edited)

Colin Hart [10:30]
sigh, a hyperbolic oversimplification of what Brynjolfsson actually argues and discusses

Get his book, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_Against_the_Machine

it’s super interesting (edited)

[10:31]
@adamscottkriger:

Adam Kriger [10:31]
@colinhart: looks very interesting!

Colin Hart [10:33]
This article makes it sound like we’re coding ourselves out of jobs, when the argument is more that the result of software development, is that lower wage jobs, service jobs—the obvious example being cashiers—get replaced by machines. Which means that policy makers need to provide better support for retraining, better k12 education, and that possibly America might consider not emphasizing that we all continue to work as many hours per week as we can fit in (edited)

Adam Kriger [10:36]
@colinhart: I agree. It’s definitely alarmist and I don’t think it tracks with the reality on the ground. Coding jobs are in demand and I think they will be for the foreseeable future.

Caleb Rechten [10:37]
If a machine can do the job better than a human, it should.

@group I'm putting together a lesson on algorithmic analysis ( how much work does the computer do with my function?)

[14:54]
I'd like to do it this Wednesday 10-12

[14:55]
It's an optional lesson, stay in the class of you want the lesson. Who's interested?

Big O is a pretty heady topic, but you should be familiar with it when you go on interviews.

creating a universe is a detail oriented task. i should program some angels to take care of things for me while i sit back and like, breathe on things.

infinite inertia seems to prevent tunneling out of the universe. good to know!
