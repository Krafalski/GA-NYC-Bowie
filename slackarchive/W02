Hey guys! So, I have a webapp that I've been working on which is one of the reasons I signed up for this class. I think it would be perfect for the app contest that Emine posted earlier and I would love to hear what you guys think about it. If everyone's cool with it, I figure Wednesday after class would be the perfect time to share it.

@channel:  Hi Guys. I was wondering if anyone would be interested in going to the [Uncommons](https://www.uncommonsnyc.com/) on Wednesday (a boardgame Cafe in Greenwich Village) to play a game and get to know each other better. I know there are 30 of us, and if everyone is interested, we would need to reserve a room ($10/person). Otherwise, we can just get a table and pay the $5 cover fee.

The Uncommons
Manhattan's Only Board Game Cafe • The Uncommons NYC
Magic: The Gathering, Cards Against Humanity, and hundreds of games for sale & play. Beer, wine, & coffee make it one of New York City's most unique spots.

@group: I invited all of you to the Persephone Science Fair. Persephone is the name of the WDI class that is graduating this week. The Science Fair is where the graduating students get to show off their applications to the rest of the school, and possibly recruiters.

The event will be held in the 3rd floor concourse and is open to anyone. Get there early, as it tends to get loud and crowded.

Please show them some support! You guys will be doing the same in about 10 weeks!

does anyone know what does function #8 mean? add each hobbit and buddy one at a time to 'the-fellowship’, thanks!

Maxwell Rayman [22:14]
@auvemma: just did that one - I think you have to create a <div> element with id = ‘the-fellowship’  and append that to ‘rivendale’. Then find a way to add all 4 hobbits and all 5 buddies as children to the <div></div> that you made

Emma Hou [22:15]

@auvemma: i think you need to use a while loop but i wasnt exactly sure how to implement it. it seems that when you appendChild an already-existing element it changes the array size of both ends

[22:30]
@auvemma: i just made each run of the while loop return (for example) hobbits[0] so every time it ran it added the first element and then deleted it from the looping array

one of these days im going to realize that i need to type EXACTLY what the thing im trying to needs me to type and not “close enough"

Caleb Rechten [10:26]
what does it mean for the createTamagochi() function?

Maxwell Rayman [10:27]
create a variable assigned to a new Tamagochi and push it into the animals array

Caleb Rechten [10:28]
Yeah, that's basically what it said to do, but why am I creating it inside the zoo?

Maxwell Rayman [10:29]
so you can do do var myZoo = new Zoo(); and then if you want to make a new tamagochi inside the zoo you just do myZoo.createTamagochi();

Caleb Rechten [10:30]
I suppose I'm still iffy on how to call the original constructor function on the variable inside the zoo constructor unless I moved the entire thing inside the zoo constructor. But I feel like I shouldn't need to do that?

Going back to the Tamagochi 2.0 again, is the numberOfResidence completely arbitrary? It's not mentioned again after we're told to set it to 0 and we can just do .length on the array, no?

Patrick McWilliams [11:10]
it will change depending on how you fill up your zoo, and .length is probably a fair way to figure that out, but im not looking at the assignment for particulars

Maxwell Rayman [11:14]
@umbrellagun: pretty sure its just there to practice writing a method that can return the length, its not used anywhere else on the assignment though

Umbrella gun was MY idea!

Seif Dorani [14:40]
hahahahahah #classic

Peter Petrov [14:45]
**Static (default):**
* The only reason you would ever set an element to position: static is to forcefully-remove some positioning that got applied to an element outside of your control. This is fairly rare, as positioning doesn't cascade.

**Relative:**
* Allows nudging elements in different directions with top, right, bottom and left values. Its starting point is where it normally lies in the flow of the document, not the top left of the page.
* When set to position relative, elements take up the same amount of space at the same exact position it was supposed to take as if its position was static.
* It introduces the ability to use z-index on that element, which doesn't really work with statically positioned elements. Even if you don't set a z-index value, this element will now appear on top of any other statically positioned element.
* It limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements. Any element that is a child of the relatively positioned element can be absolutely positioned within that block.

**Absolute:**
* Position absolute takes the element out of the document flow. This means that it no longer takes up any space like what static and relative does. Think of it as an element with a giant strip of velcro on its back. Just tell it where to stick and it sticks.
* You use the positioning attributes top, left, bottom and right to set the location. Remember that these values will be relative to the next parent element with relative (or absolute) positioning. If there is no such parent, it will default all the way back up to the <html> element itself meaning it will be placed relatively to the page itself.
* The trade-off, and most important thing to remember, about absolute positioning is that these elements are removed from the flow of elements on the page. An element with this type of positioning is not affected by other elements and it doesn't affect other elements.

**Fixed:**
* Similar to position absolute, an element that has fixed position is taken out of the document flow.
* The element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself.
* Major difference with position absolute is it always takes its positioning relative to the browser window.
* Since the fixed value behaves similar to the absolute value, we can stretch the width of the element to fit the viewport by setting offset values for left and right to zero.

Rachel Smyth [21:50]
@patrickm, @karolin, @trampolinetales you can declare stuff before your switch statement, and within cases, but not between switch and case.

```//good idea
var thing = 'stuff'
switch (thing)
   //bad idea
   var x = 'new thing';
  case 'stuff':
      //good idea
     var x = 'new thing';
    break;

so, for loanbot i have the following code which works in node:

added and commented on a JavaScript/JSON snippet
if(this.marks[person]===undefined){
      this.marks[person]=amount;
      console.log('This is ' + person + '\'s first loan. The loan amount is ' + this.marks[person] + ' dollars.');
    }

but spits an error at line1 (here) that this.marks[person] is undefined.

Patrick McWilliams [13:17]
(when in browser console). is there a way i can get that line to finish evaluating?

note: there’s an else following that for what do to when that is already defined

```To do this, once Reddit.com has loaded, go to your view menu in Chrome. Select View > Developer > JavaScript Console

Once that's loaded, try entering the following command into the Chrome REPL:

$('img').hide()
Hit enter. All the images should have dissappeared from the Reddit.com home page. Make sure you understand why before moving on.

Now try this:

$('img').show()
That should have brought all the images back. Make sense so far?

Now with the chrome inspector, try to match the title of the first reddit post and replace the text using .text() or .html().

Try to replace the blue background in the header by another color using the function .css().

Now try some of the other examples we've gone over in the Chrome REPL and see what happens to the Reddit.com website. Remember, this is your laboratory — your chance to experiment and learn. Make use of it.```

@feudi: im pretty sure* when you have a conditional 'x === y === z’ and they are all the same, it will return false because it does ‘x === y’ = true -> true === z = false (edited)

Hey @eminekoc come on up

Caleb Rechten [20:01]
So, I just want to clarify something. The whole Prototype thing, should we pretty much always want to declare functions for a constructor this way? Or are there some exceptions besides it maybe not being a big deal if we're working on something smaller? OR did I completely miss something?

jason Seminara [20:42]
@umbrellagun: it's common practice to set simple attributes in the constructor, and methods on the prototype. Essentially, any shared property should be part of the proto.

[20:43]
There isn't any rule, but re duplicating your functions, keep in mind that you're wasting space/memory each time the same function gets recreated/stored. (edited)

Caleb Rechten [20:54]
@jasonseminara Okay, awesome. Thank you!

Yeah, trying to get a loop to grab all the Pokemans, run them through the object constructor, and return them to an array. I think I can manage that, but I wanted them to each be appropriately named. I guess it won’t matter since their name will be stored inside the object anyway

[22:26]
Oooooh when my loops work it makes me all fuzzy inside

Inheritance and the prototype chain
JavaScript is a bit confusing for developers experienced in class-based languages (like Java or C++), as it is dynamic and does not provide a class implementation per se (the class keyword is introduced in ES6, but is syntactical sugar, JavaScript remaining prototype-based).

@pppetrov:  Sorry, the $(handler) is perfectly ok. It is $().ready(handler) that is not recommended by Jquery.
```All three of the following syntaxes are equivalent:
  $( document ).ready( handler )
  $().ready( handler ) (this is not recommended)
  $( handler )
There is also $(document).on( "ready", handler ), deprecated as of jQuery 1.8. This behaves similarly to the ready method but if the ready event has already fired and you try to .on( "ready" ) the bound handler will not be executed. Ready handlers bound this way are executed after any bound by the other three methods above.

Cloud Spin: creating 180-degree Matrix-like videos with mobile phones and the cloud

What is it about?
Cloud Spin is a demo that a team of Googlers developed to showcase the Google Cloud Platform. The demo consists of 19 mobile phones placed in a half-circle to create a frozen-in-time 180 degree animated GIF. See examples at @googlecloudspin on Twitter!

Googler Bret McGowen walks through how the team built the demo using a wide range of technologies: cloud, Android, Firebase, JavaScript, and more!

When:
Friday, February 5th from 12:30pm-1:30pm

Where:
3rd Floor Concourse

for anyone who needs to make a deck of cards using just html and css… I found this useful http://designshack.net/articles/css/css-card-tricks/
Know any good card tricks? Hopefully, after today, you will! We’re going to build some simple and attractive playing cards with pure CSS, then we’ll learn how to target and animate each card for some added fun. Along the way, we’ll see how to use before and after to build the cards with minimal markup. […]

@group Code Freeze at 8pm!

End of project week tips:

1. Be extra diligent to keep your developing code separate from your production code that you know works.

2. Double check your goals for the day and narrow it down to goals that you think you can meet by 6pm. That way you have buffer time in case you have merge issues or deployment issues.

3. Polish your production code (your working code that exists on master): i.e. spend some time with css, delete extraneous comments like old code, delete all console.logs unless they are necessary for your game. (edited)

[16:58]
 ```git branch -D gh-pages

Harry Ganz [17:25]
@pppetrov @feudi : Yah, I understand why gh-pages is an orphan, but it makes it so annoying to push to because it keeps saying there are merge conflicts. I opted to make it a regular branch to help save my sanity. Is this a really bad practice?

[17:26]
@channel:  Have a great superb owl

jason Seminara [17:39]
@group you should ALWAYS `--force` the push to gh pages

[17:41]
You don't care about the state of gh pages. You just want it to be the thing you're pushing. This is the first step to understanding deployment: the live server should ALWAYS be force pushed.

Patrick McWilliams [17:49]
so would the command be (from the branch you want to deploy)...

Patrick McWilliams [17:50]
added a JavaScript/JSON snippet
git push --force origin gh-pages

if you have code taken from/inspired by a stack overflow answer, is proving a link in a comment near the relative code sufficient?
