@group anyone able to successfully update the timezone for heroku? I was able to change UTC to EST but it did not actually update to the current time

Caleb Rechten [07:08]
Hey guys, maybe it's a bit late for today, but some future advice about writing in general (and specifically for the cover letters), present tense is much more engaging. If you can write about what you are doing 'now', it will sound more real. If you don't get what I mean, just ask me in person later.
1

[07:10]
p.s. if you force present tense, it sounds weird and doesn't make sense, but use it when you can.

Caleb Rechten [07:20]
Example: ‘I built projects like suchandsuch and suchandsuch 2’ vs. ‘I build projects like suchandsuch and suchandsuch 2’

So what type should our column be to store a timestamp? I have it as VARCHAR atm, because VARCHAR nearly works with everything, but is there something more specific? I found 'timestamp', but I don't know if that would limit me to only the way psql handles time. Also, @jasonseminara you mentioned an npm module, but I can't remember what it was called.

jason Seminara [08:22]

There’s more to the CSS rem unit than font sizing | CSS-Tricks
Many web designers and developers are familiar with the CSS rem length unit. But, you may not know that it has a couple of handy alternate uses. In this post, I’ll describe how to use the CSS rem unit to scale specific page elements while leaving others unaffected. I’ll also discuss how to use it as a replacement for the under-supported vw (viewporth width) unit.
