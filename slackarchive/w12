CSS Specificity: Things You Should Know – Smashing Magazine
Apart from Floats, the CSS Specificity is one of the most difficult concepts to grasp in Cascading Stylesheets. The different weight of selectors is usually the reason why your CSS-rules don't apply to some elements, although you think they should have. In order to minimize the time for bug hunting you need to understand, how browsers interpret your code. And to understand that, you need to have a firm understanding on how specificity works.

For late arrivals:

No coding till 1:30.

Spend the morning building up a map/document (whatever) that outlines the current state of your application. All of the features that are built, half built, partially built, not yet built. Make sure your user stories and GitHub issues reflect this.

Any specific  bugs, fixes,polishing  you want to implement or notice as you’re testing your application as it currently exists make a user story for it.

By 12:30, you should have a solid idea of what you have and have not built yet, the features in your application that work or don’t work. And you should have a slew of new issues. Both small and large tasks.

Hi team,

Hope that you are enjoying the lovely new tables!

We have noticed people standing on the tables to reach the projectors.  The new tables cannot carry heavy weight and one has already broken.  Nobody was injured, but this is a serious safety issue.

We take the safety of our students and staff very seriously and must emphasize this rule:

Please do no stand or sit on the tables

If you need to reach the projector, we are installing step ladders in each classroom ASAP.  In the meantime, please get a Front Lines staff member to help you with the projector if you need to reach it.

Thank you in advance for keeping GA a safe place to learn.

@group I highly recommend you all take a break from coding to sit in on this ux lesson taught by one of the UX immersive instructors.

Per our other talks of you are not planning on participating please move out of the classroom and work in the lobby.

anyone know how to make a site adaptive for mobile?

Harry Ganz [12:57]
@adamscottkriger: Short answer: with great difficulty. Slightly longer answer: Css media queries and great difficulty. Answer of approximately the same length as the slightly longer answer: Using a responsive framework like bootstrap or purecss.

woooHOOOO :triumph: ​*NEW PROBLEMS*​

Karolin Rafalski [15:28]
why is that emoji called triumph?

Patrick McWilliams [15:28]
i dunno

[15:29]
but im going with it

Karolin Rafalski [15:30]
I am going to check the definition of triumph, maybe it doesn’t mean what I thought it means...

@group Are we frozen tonight? 8PM?

[16:27]
/giphy freeze
freeze (990KB)


Colin Hart [16:28]
@group reminder. No actual code freeze tonight. But you should self enforce. Make sure your working presentable project is done by like 8 like done done done. Not starting to deploy etc...

Make sure any work you keep doing is on a separate branch from your functioning peoject. My advice is 100 percent don't merge it till Wednesday

Caleb Rechten [17:12]
Hey, anyone deploy Rails/React on heroku yet?

Karolin Rafalski [17:12]
I have been trying to for a few hours now

Caleb Rechten [17:13]
I just started. Unsurprisingly, Heroku doesn't seem to like it.

[17:14]
I have Rails in one folder, and React in another. I think it can't detect it because it's not expecting the app to be nested one folder in.

Karolin Rafalski [17:15]
Heroku push rejected, no Cedar-supported app detected

Caleb Rechten [17:15]
I could try deploying two separate Heroku apps, but I don't know if will work too well seeing as they go to sleep?

Karolin Rafalski [17:15]
is that the erorr

Caleb Rechten [17:16]
I have no idea what Cedar support is

Karolin Rafalski [17:16]
that’s the error I’ve been battling with

Caleb Rechten [17:16]
"Push rejected, failed to detect set buildpack"

Karolin Rafalski [17:17]
you can set the buildpack pretty easily, although even though I set mine, it still gives me the same rejection on the next step

Caleb Rechten [17:17]
Yeah, I already set it and it's not detecting it.

Karolin Rafalski [17:17]
```heroku buildpacks:set heroku/ruby```

Caleb Rechten [17:17]
But I think that's because I have them in the separate folders

Jasmine Vollherbst [17:24]
@umbrellagun: all your files need to be in the root directory. The error is heroku isn't able to find your Gemfile. I had the same problem this morning. I had a project folder within the main folder and it was making it so heroku couldn't find my files.

Caleb Rechten [17:26]
I'm scared to dump Node files in the same folder as Rails files though. I feel like Node wouldn't care, but Rails would flip the eff out. I was thinking of trying it anyway though.

Jasmine Vollherbst [17:28]
Ah. I did Rails only so it was cool. The Cedar error though is that it can't find either your Gemfile or package.json. Grrr. So frustrating!

Karolin Rafalski [17:28]
yeah I had to delete my Gemfile.lock and bundle install

[17:29]
and THEN I got stuck on a new error

Caleb Rechten [17:42]
Okay, I dumped everything into one folder (in a totally separate location so I didn't mess up the original just in case) and pushed it up and it says that everything is fine, but nothing is at the link location when I check it out.

Caleb Rechten [17:56]
It's saying "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)" in the console.

[17:56]
But of course there's no reference to which server responded with the 404

Karolin Rafalski [17:57]
```heroku run rake db:migrate```
?

Caleb Rechten [17:57]
Are we supposed to do that?

[17:58]
I wonder if it's trying to get to the rails root instead of Node's root. Like, how does it know which one to go to?

Caleb Rechten [18:05]
Yeah, that didn't do it.

[18:05]
I wouldn't think it would stop the entire app from running anyway.

Patrick McWilliams [18:13]
i’ve got my rails and react as separate repos, but deployment is a pipedream right now

Caleb Rechten [18:22]
Pushing to Heroku succeeds, but it gives me some warning about a procfile. Not 100% convinced that's the problem though

[18:24]
Hrm, actually, it might be.

Caleb Rechten [18:57]
Huh, well. Made some progress (I think). Got the procfile working, not entirely sure I understand exactly what it's doing, only sort of, and now I've got the more standard page loading that just says "Application Error" rather than "There is no application".

Caleb Rechten [19:40]
Oooooooookaaaaaayyyyyyy

[19:40]
So

[19:40]
@patrickm:  Did you get it working?

Patrick McWilliams [19:40]
ahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahhaha

[19:41]
no

[19:41]
i will not have a deployable thing by tomorrow

Caleb Rechten [19:41]
I just got it to work

Patrick McWilliams [19:41]
im still working on getting local presentable

Caleb Rechten [19:41]
You're on the right track with using pipes

Patrick McWilliams [19:42]
i didn’t mention pipes? my big idea was different repos

Caleb Rechten [19:42]
You did

Patrick McWilliams [19:44]
oh, i said pipedream as in, 'maybe one day i’ll win the lotto. ‘ but if that inspired a solution: cool!

Caleb Rechten [19:45]
Well, not just pipes, but also the idea of using separate Heroku apps
1

[19:46]
Create two and then put them into a pipeline

[19:46]
They should be able to communicate with each other then.

[19:47]
I think the only other thing I had to switch was anything that said 'localhost' to the heroku link.

[19:47]

@group Project 2 and 3 scores have been sent out!

[20:01]
It was a bit of work fighting with Google docs, so msg me if you didn’t get one, or you got 500, or if you have any questions.

Harry Ganz [20:43]
@group Are the presentations similar to the ones we did for the other projects? Is there anything very specific we need to cover?

Emma Hou [21:03]
Got 2 emails, Thanks! @jasonseminara
