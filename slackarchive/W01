Hey guys, sorry for bouncing so early. I had exactly 0 hours of sleep last night. I plan on being around as late as possible in the future, but my sleeping habit of in bed by 4ish didn't jive with my early commute time. It'll snap in place soon, but it was super meeting all of you and I'm excited for the class! Cya tomorrow!

does anyone know how to do line break in a code block? I’m trying to make the right two lines the same of the left two lines. Thanks!

Harry Ganz [21:35]
I was able to do that by de-indenting the code (on the left) by selecting the lines and pressing shift-tab. I did for every line of code.

Elton Cheng [21:37]
You can double space at the end of the line to also create a line break!

Emma Hou [21:38]
Thank you Harry and Elton!

Peter Petrov [21:41]
Good Job figuring out the indenting. Markdown has a few nice and smart ways it uses indentation!

jason Seminara [23:16]
@group just to clarify a few terms I stated in today’s lecture:
a file in a filesystem can either be text-based or in binary, where:
  - ​*text*​ files are readable by humans using some human alphabet (e.g. english, japanese, hebrew, etc)
 - ​*binary*​ files are only readable by another software application, and are usually indecipherable if opened directly. (e.g. images, music, programs, etc)
 - ​*executable*​ binaries are special binaries that are ​*executable*​. This means that another user or software can **activate** (start) them. (eg. applications, itunes, Firefox, etc)

The main difference between the last two is that only applications can be ‘executed’ or ‘activated’, and all other files can be read.

For example, Photoshop is an executable binary that can read and write images. A human cannot reliably read the contents of either the image or the Photoshop binary without special software to decode it. (edited)

[23:19]
​*all*​ files we work with in the command line/terminal will be text-based.

Tyler Gates [23:46]
Hey guys, I don’t know if anyone is up/looking at this, but for some reason when I’m trying to move the millenium_falcon into galaxy_far_far_away it keeps trying to rename it rather than moving it. What am I doing wrong?






----- January 20th -----
Elton Cheng [01:09]
@tyler_gates: It sounds like you’re placing the millenium_falcon back into the same folder. You need to make sure you’re sending it to the correct location.

mv ~/…/tatooine/millenium_falcon ~/…/galaxy_far_far_away
It should look something like that.

[01:11]
@tyler_gates: the basic format is mv whereYouAreAt whereYouWantToGo. Also, since galaxy_far_far_away contains the tatooine directory, you can use the “..” shortcut. mv ~/…/tatooine/millenium_falcon ..             If I’ve said anything wrong please correct me!

Fixing the JavaScript typeof operator
Working with JavaScript’s typeof operator is a bit like operating a clapped-out old car (or an early model Dell Inspiron). It gets the job done (mostly) and you learn to work around the quirks – but you probably aspire to something better.
In this article I’ll give a brief overview of typeof before introducing a tiny new function which is a fully-loaded, more reliable alternative that works directly with the language internals.

@harryg: showboating! :unamused: (edited)

[11:44]
@harryg: here’s a better challenge: how many (actual) different operators are in your expression?

Harry Ganz [11:45]
Actually, I didn't need the XOR. This is equivalent:
```~[[]+[]]
```

[11:45]
= ~0 = -1

# Data Structures!

A big part of your job as programmers is going to be figuring out how to organize your data. For now lets focus on the javascript data structures we covered today. We are going to try and describe a simplified version of the MTA. For this exercise work in the node console.

## Beginnings of the MTA
Imagine you are a developer back in 1904 working with the city administration to model the first subway line built. Let's pretend it was called the "N" line. The N has 6 stops which are ​*Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th*​. Try figure out which data structure we talked about today which can accommodate the name of the line and its stops and allows for an easy way to access the different stops and list them in the console. Once you do this try to achieve the following:
1. Log the first stop
2. Log the 5th stop
3. Log the last stop
4. List all stops on separate lines

Patrick McWilliams [12:20]
I feel like I’m going to have nightmares starring that thing.

Rachel Smyth [12:52]
Today’s “food-for-thought” lunchtime tip:

It’s never too early to start good habits. Practice writing ​*​_specific_​*​ commit messages on your hw. When you’ve got 2 or 3 commits, it’s easy to remember what happened in each one. But on a project with 102 commits `first draft of caffeine problem` or `fixed kilobits conversion error` is way clearer than `submitted draft` or `done`.

Keep up the good work everyone! :smile: :+1: :100:

## The MTA Grows
Fast forward a few years. The MTA has tripled in size and now has three separate lines.

- The **N** line has the following stops: ​*Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th*​
- The **L** line has the following stops: ​*8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st*​
- The **6** line has the following stops: ​*Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place*​.

As the main developer on the project you need to modify your data structure to accommodate all the new information. Design a data structure which you will store in a variable called `mta`, which will allow for an natural way to access everything. Here are a few things you should be able to do with the least amount of typing

- Access all the stops for the **L** line. (note that you should be able to access the **L** line through its name, and not its index)
- Access the 3rd stop of the **6** line
- Access the last stop of the **N** line

Bonus:

Iterate through your data structure and log to the console

   The N line has  6 stops. They are: Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th
   The L line has 5 stops. They are: 8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st
   The 6 line has 6 stops. They are: Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place

Make sure your code does not have any **hard coded** information. All your specific line and stop names and their number come from your `mta` variable.

    N: ['Times Sq', '34th', '28th', '23rd', 'Union Sq', 'Astor Pl']
}

console.log(mta.L);                            //all L line stops

@group

Friendly reminder:
1. Take breaks. Your code will thank you for it.
2. If you have a big problem that you're a little overwhelmed by, break it down into more bite-size problems. (Example -- you know you have to manipulate something. First you need to identify what you need. Grab that thing. Then do what you need to it.)

trying to use value===(x||y||z) and it only seems to evaluate true when value===x. do i need to split that up into something like ( (value===x)||(value===y)||(value===z)) ? that seems like a lot of = signs

Dan Dilorio [21:52]
@patrickm: I believe you do have to split it up exactly as you said

Peter Petrov [21:52]
Seconded!

Patrick McWilliams [21:53]
booooo! thanks

Peter Petrov [21:55]
The reason your first one doesn't work is operator precedence. Think about what gets evaluated first and what to?

Patrick McWilliams [22:00]
if x is false, and since it’s OR, shouldn’t it check the next value (y)?

Karolin Rafalski [22:08]
I think you can assign variables that way, but not compare them. For example : `var value = false || false || 3;` evaluates to 3- which is similar to part of what we did for rock paper scissors.

jason Seminara [22:34]
@patrickm: I’m not sure what you’re seeing, but this syntax  works as expected (i even threw in some curveballs):
```true === (undefined || null || false || true) //  evals to true
```

[22:37]
@karolin is correct. Leveraging JS’s ability to eval falsey things and ’short-circuit' evaluation allows you to do something like this:
```var a = (undefined || null||false||2||false) // a is 2
```
(edited)

[22:38]
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators#Short-Circuit_Evaluation

Mozilla Developer Network
Logical Operators
Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values. When they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value.

and make sure to use ‘Union Square’ as one argument

Patrick McWilliams [23:20]
@jasonseminara: I was trying to check a user input via process.argv[]  and it would only behave “correctly” for ===(x||y||z) when  x was used. y and z were completely ignored. works when using the extended version. would process.argv be throwing a wrench into the works? @karolin thanks, it seems that using it in a comparison was the problem. can you point me at any documentation that explains why it can’t be used that way?

Karolin Rafalski [23:56]
I have found that I need more explanations than what MDN provides, and have found that, for me and my learning process, the books Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke (free pdf version: http://eloquentjavascript.net ) and Learning Web Design: A Beginner’s Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web Graphics have been helpful to me in trying to understand stuff.  I don’t have my copy of the latter around…but since I didn’t see it in Eloquent JavaScript, I think maybe it was in the latter book?

----- January 22nd -----
Karolin Rafalski [00:02]
Also, it wasn’t clear if the values you were trying to compare were all…er…truthy? Like `3|| "q" || "L" ` that will give you 3 in the console. Maybe that’s how it was working in your original expression?

fyi if you want to open a file in a new atom window, you can put -n in the command to do so:
atom -n filename
would open filename in a new atom window (instead of a new tab)

A read–eval–print loop (REPL), also known as an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e. single expressions), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise.

If you're still shaky on hoisting make sure you understand why each of these happens
```foo(); // TypeError "foo is not a function"
bar(); // valid
baz(); // TypeError "baz is not a function"
bin(); // ReferenceError "bin is not defined"

var foo = function () {}; // anonymous function expression ('foo' gets hoisted)
function bar() {}; // function declaration ('bar' and the function body get hoisted)
var baz = function bin() {}; // named function expression (only 'baz' gets hoisted)

foo(); // valid
bar(); // valid
baz(); // valid
bin(); // ReferenceError "bin is not defined"
```

for some reason I cant stage or commit my files as normal, anyone see what I’m doing wrong?

[11:56]
thanks!

Karolin Rafalski [11:58]
hi Ari, I think you are in your classwork directory and hangman is in the homework directory either switch into homework and do git add .   or do git add /pathtohomework

Ari Ingber [12:03]
thanks Karolin I’ll try that

[12:04]
you’re right Karolin! thank you

Hey guys, probably cant make it today but I’ll be around slack to help people with whatever I can. I have a question though - does anybody remember / have written down the command in terminal for npm to make your working directory readline-sync compatible? My homework directory seems to not have it enabled.

Karolin Rafalski [12:56]
`npm install readline-sync`

someone come up with an algorithm for me to decide how to split my time between coding and shoveling

Dan Dilorio [13:13]

shoveling = false;
if (!coding) { shoveling = true; }
if (!shoveling) { coding = true; }

Jonathan Feudi [13:14]
This is why you don’t write your code directly into node

Dan Dilorio [13:14]
:wink:

[13:15]
@feudi: also, you can just say `if (coding) { ... }` instead of `if (coding == true) { ... }`

Jonathan Feudi [13:15]
This is why you don’t make coding jokes into the Slack channel

I dug my stuff out … no way I wanted to try it after it half melted all day and then formed a thick shell of ice...

Patrick McWilliams [14:16]
i’ve been mucking around with this for way too long. when i paste it into node and hit enter i get “…” on the next line and can’t figure out why. am I missing something super obvious (probably)? ...

[14:16]
`function Letter(guess) {
 //this.data = guess;
 var letterObj = {
 this.value = guess,
 this.hidden = true,
 this.hide = function(){
   this.hidden = true
 },
 this.show = function(){
   this.hidden = false
 },
 this.render = function(){
   if(this.hidden===true){
     console.log{'_'};

use the plus sign on the left of the text input in slack to create a snippet, post or upload a file

[14:20]
what I do is when I think I have a syntax error- I paste the code into repl.it and look at it there: then it gives you the errors, red ‘x’es and if you mouse over them, they may give even more information (edited)

Lol, I figured it out. I am missing a line return after the ------ in the second element

Patrick McWilliams [18:51]
so after struggling with it for hours. i got part of Word working.

[18:51]
return statements are important folks, especially if you’re checking one function at a time.

Patrick McWilliams [20:47]
anyone else having difficulty getting the try function to reference the letters array?

Peter Nguyen [20:55]
@patrickm: what’s the problem that you’re having?

Patrick McWilliams [20:56]
so, letters and try are siblings as far as scope is concerned (i think)

[20:57]
i want to reference letters in my try function

Harry Ganz [20:57]
@patrickm:  Can you copy/paste a code snippet?

Patrick McWilliams [20:57]
added a Plain Text snippet
function Word(){
  console.log('Word was called');
  var wordObj = {
  letters : [''],
  getLetters : function(newWord){
Add Comment Click to expand inline 25 lines
Harry Ganz [21:00]
@patrick: If Word is a function, try using the "this" keyword, e.g.
```function Word(){
  this.letters = [];
  this.getLetters = function(newWord){
    this.letters = newWord.split('');
  };
 // etc
}
```

[21:03]
Also, yah. Use the this keyword, even if you keep the wordObj variable:
```// some code
for(var i = 0; i < this.letters.length; i++){
  if(letter === this.letters[i]){
    return true;
  }
// More code
```
(edited)

[21:04]
Just be careful if you use the "this" keyword in a callback, as it won't do what you think

Jonathan Feudi [22:29]
Anyone around?

[22:30]
I’ve gotten my first two functions written, but I have no idea how to test them really

Karolin Rafalski [22:30]
I was about to sign off, but I can spare a few more minutes

Jonathan Feudi [22:30]
I’m just not sure how to input a word and then test if my Word and Letter functions are working

Karolin Rafalski [22:31]
through node?

Jonathan Feudi [22:31]
Or repl.it

Karolin Rafalski [22:31]
3 ways

Patrick McWilliams [22:31]
i prefer node, but i use repl.it to check for syntax errors

Karolin Rafalski [22:32]
`var testWord ="bowie";` (edited)

[22:32]
it is static but easy to start with

[22:33]
for user input

[22:33]
again `var testLetter = "o";` //or whatever letter (edited)

[22:34]
in repl.it` var testLetter = prompt("give me a letter");` (edited)

[22:34]
in node make sure you have the npm readline-sync installed/working in the folder you are working in

[22:35]
then two lines of code for that one:

[22:35]
`var rls = require('readline-sync');` (edited)

[22:35]
`var testLetter = rls.question("What is the letter you want to test?");` (edited)

Jonathan Feudi [22:36]
So, when I answer the realine-sync prompts in node, will my input get assigned to the proper values?

[22:36]
Or, do I have to call the functions on my input?

Karolin Rafalski [22:37]
what the code above does is assign the input to a variable

[22:38]
you can see what was assigned to the variable by doing `console.log(testLetter);`

[22:39]
or you can make it a little more informative `console.log("this is the value for the variable testLetter: " + testLetter);`

Jonathan Feudi [22:41]
Okay, and then call my functions on those variables?

Karolin Rafalski [22:41]
yes

Jonathan Feudi [22:41]
Okay cool

[22:41]
I’ll give it a whirl

[22:41]
Thanks much

Karolin Rafalski [22:41]
good luck!

Jonathan Feudi [22:41]
Thanks… I need it

Karolin Rafalski [22:42]
and sleep!

Karolin Rafalski [22:52]
one more thing: make sure with repl.it you are using JavaScript(web) and not just JavaScript- prompt won’t work in non (web) JavaScript

Patrick McWilliams [23:26]
good night anyone still up, get the @$#% to sleep. it will be a miracle if i finish hangman on the train tomorrow morning.
